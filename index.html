    <h1> About Visual Studio Code </h1>
    <h1> And the Console </h1>
    <p> Visual Studio Code is a coding IDE platform that is for advanced coders that wish to bump up their coding IDE.
        VS Code, as it is abbreviated, has many more features than other coding IDEs, such as Brackets. You can do many
        mathematical operations in VS Code, whether it is finding the maximum number in a set, or taking the power of 2
        numbers. There are also functions for strings in VS Code. All you have to do is go to code.visualstudio.com, and
        click the download button for your OPS, whether it is Windows, Macintosh, or Linux. </p>
    <p> To open the console, right click on a page, and click on the Inspect button. Or, if you want to use the
        shortcut, just do Cntrl + Shift + I, and the inspect page will open. After that, all you need to click on is the
        console button, and you will see the outputs and errors (if you have any) of your code. You can use console.log
        in your JavaScript code in order to see your results in the console. Also, you can see precisely which line you
        have the errors in your code using the console. Just look for the red boxes, and look at the right hand side of
        them. you will see the file name, and what line of code the error is in. Go on, open the console now to see what
        is really the content of this website! </p>
    <script>
        console.log("Hello, I am the console screen of this website!")

        var first_name = "Esther";
        var last_name = "Choi";
        console.log(first_name);
        console.log(last_name);

        var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(full_name);

        var number_one = 11;
        var number_two = 7;
        console.log(number_one);
        console.log(number_two);

        var maximum_number = Math.max(11, 7);
        var minimum_number = Math.min(11, 7);
        console.log(maximum_number);
        console.log(minimum_number);

        var increased_num_one = number_one;
        increased_num_one++;
        console.log(increased_num_one);

        var increased_num_two = number_two;
        increased_num_two++;
        console.log(increased_num_two);

        var decreased_num_one = number_one;
        decreased_num_one--;
        console.log(decreased_num_one);

        var decreased_num_two = number_two;
        decreased_num_two--;
        console.log(decreased_num_two);

        var power_of_nums = Math.pow(11, 7);
        console.log(power_of_nums);

        var power_of_nums = Math.pow(7, 11);
        console.log(power_of_nums);

        var square_root = Math.sqrt(11);
        console.log(square_root);

        var square_root = Math.sqrt(7);
        console.log(square_root);
